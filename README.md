# machine-learning-assignment
This Jupyter file explores regression techniques in machine learning as part of an assignment . 

Objective:

Application of regression models to predict or analyze a target variable.
Evaluation of model performance using various metrics.it inculdes

Data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, scaling, and encoding.
Implementation of regression algorithms, potentially including:
Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Ridge or Lasso Regression
Decision Tree or Random Forest Regression
Visualization of results and analysis of feature importance.
Libraries Used:

Commonly used Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and possibly others.
Learning Outcomes:

Insights into regression models and their applications.
Understanding the impact of different preprocessing techniques and hyperparameter tuning.

resulted in:low R2 value- indicates that the model does not explain much varience in the target variable
